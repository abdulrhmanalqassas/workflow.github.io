# Proposed Reporting System for Our Application


 I wanted to present some options for implementing a reporting system into our application, which is based on React and Node.js. After careful consideration, I have identified several tools that could be integrated into our project:

1. **ActiveReportsJS**:

   - **Features**: Comprehensive reporting tool with components like the React Report Viewer and Report Designer.
   - **Advantages**: Supports client-side exporting and printing, multiple report types, and zero server dependencies.
   - **Pricing**: Not free. Licensing options start at around $1,249 for non-commercial use and $3,999 for commercial use.

2. **react-report-builder**:

   - **Features**: Customizable reporting module with React components for filtering, sorting, and exporting reports.
   - **Advantages**: Free to use with npm, though additional costs may apply based on specific requirements.
   - **Pricing**: Free.

3. **Jikji**:

   - **Features**: Rich report generator with components for headers, footers, watermarks, and charts.
   - **Advantages**: Supports client-side rendering and server-side generation, exporting to PDF, Image, or HTML.
   - **Pricing**: Pricing information not readily available; potential cost involved.

4. **jsReport**:
   - **Features**: Open-source reporting platform with support for various output formats (PDF, Excel, DOCX, HTML, CSV).
   - **Advantages**: Includes a web-based designer, REST API, and a complete set of extensions for scheduling, templates, versioning, and more.
   - **Pricing**: Free and open-source.
## note :
 ActiveReportsJS, Jikji, and jsReport all have built-in support for exporting to PDF. For react-report-builder, you may need to use additional libraries to achieve PDF export.
## Recommendation

Based on our requirements and budget considerations, I recommend exploring **jsReport** as it offers a robust set of features and is open-source, meaning no initial cost for use. Its capabilities align well with our needs for diverse output formats and ease of integration with our current technology stack.
cons : 
it well cost money after the first month if the reports is more than 5 .
it can take more time to implement it in client side .
Please let me know if you would like more details on any of these options or have any questions.
